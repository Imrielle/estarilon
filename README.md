# About Estarilon
Estarilon is a WIP Minecraft 1.12.2 modpack with a focus on low-tech gameplay and exploration, with a medieval feel. It is intended to work well as both a single player and server modpack.
While not neccessary per-se, its entended to be used with a medieval style resource pack.


## Core Mods
### Main Features
[Ancient Warfare 2](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/ancient-warfare-2)
* Provides much of the tech-ier tech in the modpack.
* Also provides world gen in the form of random structures and towns. Since Ancient Warfare can do this and make structures biome specific, I haven't yet seen the need for a second mod to fill this.

[Minecolonies](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/minecolonies)
* Provides players with a means of colony control. While Ancient Warfare also has this, much of Minecolonies is easier to use.
* Lots of hands-off automation - tree farms, 
* Also provides medieval themed blocks that can be used without a colony - shingle blocks and timbered blocks.

[Serene Seasons](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/serene-seasons) and [Tough as Nails](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/tough-as-nails)
* Both of these are added to provide some realism and difficulty to the game, without a level of difficulty that makes a person hate themselves.
* An attempt has been made to integrate the other included mods with both, via the configs options they provide. Configs need more work, though, they are just copy and pastes of each other.

[Vanilla Food Pantry](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/vanillafoodpantry-mod)
* I decided to go with a 'Vanilla Enhanced' feel in regards to food. The reasons for this are manifold:
  * I'm aware most modpacks use Pam's instead. This isn't a problem, generally speaking, but... Pam's adds so much that its hard to fit into a modpack that strives to be integrated and cohesive. VFP doesn't.
  * 

### Magic
It wouldn't be Medieval without magic, right? Yeah, yeah, sure... magic didn't actually exist in ye olden days - but people thought it did. So, for magic we have:
* [Embers](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/embers-rekindled): For the technomancers out there, we have Embers. Not only is the magic itself well thought out, but Embers also adds in things we'd be lacking, otherwise, like metals.
* [Thaumcraft](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/thaumcraft): Not a tecnomancer? We've got you, wizards. Thaumcraft adds a really cool magic system, and even more alternate automation, if Embers, Minecolonies and AW2 don't suit a user.

### Aesthetics
I like pretty things, so we've got pretty things galore.
* [Dynamic Trees](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/dynamictrees) Beautiful trees.
* [Rustic](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/rustic): Nice furniture, lights, a simple bee system, crops, and alcohol brewing. Adds trees with Dynamic Trees support, too.
* [Familiar Fauna](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/familiar-fauna) Added purely to liven up the world. Tweaked for Thaumcraft biomes. I also plan to integrate its mobs' drops into recipes, as Pixie Dust and Snail Shells are currently unused.
* [Traverse](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/traverse)
  * I chose Traverse for the biomes mainly because of how lightweight and well done it is. Biomes o' Plenty is also well done, but it adds eleventy billion dirts, woods, grasses, bushes...
  * Traverse is also easier to integrate with everything else. Instead of needing to account for about 70 added biomes, we only need to account for 22.

### Quiet Features
These are mods that are used in a behind-the-scenes way to make things flow together
* [COFH World](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/cofh-world): I actually really like COFH worlds ore gen format. All ores added by mods (as well as several blocks and gems) are disabled in their respective configs and managed with this mod.
* [Craft Tweaker](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/crafttweaker), [Mod Tweaker](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/modtweaker), [Loot Table Tweaker](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/loottabletweaker)
  * These are used for tweaking recipes and loot tables.
* [Villager Trade Tables](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/villager-trade-tables) - to help integrate a currency system into the world. Also helps tie into AW2 - players can create and setup Trader NPC's. Minecraft villagers can accept that currency as well. Helps make the world feel more real.
